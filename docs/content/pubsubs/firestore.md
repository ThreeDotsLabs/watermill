### Firestore Pub/Sub

Cloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database from Google.

This Pub/Sub comes with two publishers. To publish messages in a transaction
use the `TransactionalPublisher`. If you do not want to publish messages in
transaction use the normal `Publisher`.

Using Firestore as a Pub/Sub instead of using a dedicated Pub/Sub system can be
useful to publish messages in transaction while at the same time saving other
data in Firestore. Thanks to that the data and the messages can be consistently
persisted. If the messages and the data weren't being published transactionally
you could end up in situations where messages were emitted even though the data
wasn't saved or messages weren't emitted even though the data was saved. After
transactionally publishing messages in Firestore you can then subscribe to them
and relay them to a different Pub/Sub system.

#### Configuration

##### Publisher configuration

{{% /render-md %}}

##### Subscriber configuration

{{% /render-md %}}

##### Subscription name

To receive messages published to a topic, you must create a subscription to
that topic. Only messages published to the topic after the subscription is
created will be received by the subscribers.

A topic can have multiple subscriptions, but a given subscription belongs to a
single topic.

In Watermill, the subscription is created automatically during calling
`Subscribe()`. Subscription name is generated by function passed to
`SubscriberConfig.GenerateSubscriptionName`. By default, it is just the topic
name with a suffix `_sub` appended to it.

If you want to consume messages from a topic with multiple subscribers
processing the incoming messages in a different way, you should use a custom
function to generate unique subscription names for each subscriber.

#### Marshaler

Watermill's messages cannot be stored directly in Firestore. The marshaler is
responsible for converting them to a type which can be stored by Firestore.
The default implementation should be enough for most applications so it is
unlikely that you need to implement your own marshaler.
