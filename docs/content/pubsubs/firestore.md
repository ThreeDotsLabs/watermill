### Firestore Pub/Sub

Cloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database from Google.

This Pub/Sub comes with two publishers. To publish messages in a transaction
(for example while at the same time saving other data) use the
`TransactionalPublisher`. If you do not want to publish messages in transaction
use the normal `Publisher`.

#### Configuration

##### Publisher configuration

{{% render-md %}}
{{% load-snippet-partial file="src-link/watermill-firestore/pkg/firestore/publisher.go" first_line_contains="type PublisherConfig struct {" last_line_equals="}" %}}
{{% /render-md %}}

##### Subscriber configuration

{{% /render-md %}}

##### Subscription name

To receive messages published to a topic, you must create a subscription to
that topic. Only messages published to the topic after the subscription is
created will be received by the subscribers.

A topic can have multiple subscriptions, but a given subscription belongs to a
single topic.

In Watermill, the subscription is created automatically during calling
`Subscribe()`. Subscription name is generated by function passed to
`SubscriberConfig.GenerateSubscriptionName`. By default, it is just the topic
name with a suffix `_sub` appended to it.

If you want to consume messages from a topic with multiple subscribers
processing the incoming messages in a different way, you should use a custom
function to generate unique subscription names for each subscriber.

#### Marshaler

Watermill's messages cannot be stored directly in Firestore. The marshaler is
responsible for converting them to a type which can be stored by Firestore.
The default implementation should be enough for most applications so it is
unlikely that you need to implement your own marshaler.
