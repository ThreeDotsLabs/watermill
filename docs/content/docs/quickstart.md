Watermill Quickstart is a hands-on training that will teach you how to use Watermill, a Go library for building event-driven applications, in your project.
Basic Go knowledge is all you need to get started.

It's available on [Three Dots Labs Academy](https://academy.threedots.tech/trainings/watermill-quickstart/start) and completely free.
You can quickly get started with a guest account — the instructions are on the training page.

You'll learn the basics of Watermill and a few more advanced concepts:

* The 3 core APIs: Publisher/Subscriber, Router, and CQRS.
* Working with Kafka.
* Topic topology, middleware, consumer groups.
* Message ordering.
* The Outbox pattern (with Postgres).
