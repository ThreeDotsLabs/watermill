Watermill is a Go library for working efficiently with message streams. It is intended
for building event driven applications, enabling event sourcing, RPC over messages,
sagas and basically whatever else comes to your mind. You can use conventional pub/sub
implementations like Kafka or RabbitMQ, but also HTTP or MySQL binlog if that fits your use case.
