{{- /*
Renders an HTML img element, in multiple formats and sizes.

It resolves internal destinations by looking for a matching:

  1. Page resource (an image in the current page bundle)
  2. Section resource (an image in the current section)
  3. Global resource (an image in the assets directory)

It skips the section resource lookup if the current page is a leaf bundle, and
captures external destinations as resources for local hosting. The build will
fail if this shortcode is unable to resolve a destination.

You must place global resources in the assets directory. If you have placed
your resources in the static directory, and you are unable or unwilling to move
them, you must mount the static directory to the assets directory by including
both of these entries in your site configuration:

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'assets'
  target = 'assets'

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'static'
  target = 'assets'

Add this CSS to your site to enable responsive image behavior:

  img {
    height: auto;
    max-width: 100%;
  }

Add this CSS to your site to remove small gaps between adjacent elements:

  img, picture {
    font-size: 0;
  }

This shortcode is a wrapper for, and requires, the img partial:
<https://www.veriphor.com/articles/images-with-overlays/#partial-source-code>

@context {string} Inner The content between the opening and closing shortcode tags.
@context {string} InnerDeindent The content between the opening and closing shortcode tags with indentation removed.
@context {string} Name The file name of the shortcode template, excluding the extension.
@context {int} Ordinal The zero-based ordinal of the shortcode on the page, or within its parent shortcode.
@context {page} Page A reference to the page containing the shortcode.
@context {map} Params The parameters specified in the opening shortcode tag.
@context {hugolib.ShortcodeWithPage} Parent The context of the parent shortcode.
@context {text.Position} Position The position of the shortcode within the page content.

@method {any} Get Returns the parameter value for the given key (for named parameters) or position (for positional parameters).
@mathod {bool} IsNamedParams Returns true if the shortcode is called with named instead of positional parameters.
@method {maps.Scratch) Scratch Returns a writable Scratch to store and manipulate data.

@param {string} [src] The path to the image: a page resource, a global resource, or a remote resource.
@param {int} [width] The display width of the image, in pixels, falling back to 100% of the viewport width.
@param {string} [sizes] = "" # "100vw", "75vw", or "auto" for example
@param {string slice} [formats] A slice of image formats, ordered by precedence, to use when creating images for the srcset attribute of each source element.
@param {string} [process] = "" # "fill 1600x900" for example
@param {string} [lqip] = "" # "16x webp q20" or "21x webp q20" for example
@param {string} [decoding] The img element's decoding attribute.
@param {string} [fetchpriority] The img element's fetchpriority attribute.
@param {string} [loading] The img element's loading attribute.
@param {string} [alt] The img element's alt attribute.
@param {string} [title] The img element's title attribute.
@param {string} [class] The img element's class attribute.

@returns {template.HTML}

@example (required args only)

  {{< img src="images/zion-national-park.jpg" >}}

@example (all args)
