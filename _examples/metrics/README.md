### Prometheus metrics showcase

This is an example application that showcases how Watermill may be monitored with Prometheus metrics.

The docker-compose bundle contains the following services:

#### Golang
 A [Golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) image which runs the [example code](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/blob/master/_examples/metrics/main.go). It consists of a router with a single handler. 
 
 The handler consumes messages from a [Gochannel PubSub](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/tree/master/message/infrastructure/gochannel), and publishes 0-4 copies of the message with a preconfigured random delay.

Additionally, there is one goroutine which produces messages incoming to the handler with a gochannel publisher, and another goroutine which consumes the messages outgoing from the handler.

The router, the standalone publisher and the standalone subscriber are all decorated with the metrics code and their statistics will appear in the dashboard.

#### Prometheus
[Prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/), to scrape the metrics which the golang application exposes at `:8081/metrics` by default. It is configured by a [prometheus.yml](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/blob/master/_examples/metrics/prometheus.yml) file, which declares the endpoints that Prometheus will scrape.

#### Grafana
[Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana), to visualize the metrics in a dashboard.

#### Running the example

To run the docker-compose bundle, go to `_examples/metrics` and execute:

```
docker-compose up
```

The golang app will start running, producing messages, passing them through the handler, and consuming the copies.

With default settings, the raw Prometheus metrics should appear at your http://localhost:8081/metrics. 

The Prometheus image should expose a more advanced UI at http://localhost:9090/graph, where you can investigate all the scraped metrics.

However, what is the most useful way to monitor is through the use of Grafana, which you can access at http://localhost:3000. 

#### Adding the Prometheus data source to Grafana

The fresh Grafana image should greet you with a login screen:

![Grafana login screen](https://threedots.tech/watermill-io/grafana_login.png)

Just use the default `admin:admin` credentials. You can skip changing the password, if you wish.

The next thing that we need to do is to add the Prometheus data source. Click on `Add data source`.

In the following screen:

1. Enter a name for the Prometheus data source. Let's name this data source `prometheus`.
1. Choose `Prometheus` from the `Type` dropdown.
1. Enter the `http://localhost:9090` value in the HTTP/URL section.
1. You can leave the remaining settings at default and click `Save & Test`.

The Prometheus data source is now ready to use in Grafana.

#### Importing the Grafana dashboard

We have prepared a Grafana dashboard that visualizes the metrics exported by this example.

To import the Grafana dashboard, select Dashboard/Manage from the left menu, and then click on `+Import` (or go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/import).

Enter the dashboard URL https://grafana.com/dashboards/9777 (or just the ID, 9777), and click on Load.

Then select the Prometheus data source created in the previous step. Click on `Import`, and you're done!
